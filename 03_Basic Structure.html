    <h1>Basic Structure</h1>
    <p>Every HTML document consists of the following basic structure:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>DOCTYPE declaration</li>
      <li>HTML element</li>
      <li>Head element</li>
      <li>Body element</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>DOCTYPE Declaration</h2>
    <p>
      The DOCTYPE declaration is the first line of an HTML document and tells
      the browser which version of HTML the document is written in. It is not an
      HTML tag, but rather an instruction to the browser. The DOCTYPE
      declaration for HTML5 is as follows:
    </p>

    <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</pre>

    <h2>HTML Element</h2>
    <p>
      The HTML element is the root element of an HTML document and contains all
      other elements. It is denoted by the opening and closing &lt;html&gt;
      tags.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;html&gt;
    ...
&lt;/html&gt;</pre
    >

    <h2>Head Element</h2>
    <p>
      The head element contains meta-information about the document, such as its
      title, links to stylesheets, and scripts. It is denoted by the opening and
      closing &lt;head&gt; tags.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;head&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/head&gt;</pre
    >

    <h2>Body Element</h2>
    <p>
      The body element contains the content of the document, such as text,
      images, links, and other elements. It is denoted by the opening and
      closing &lt;body&gt; tags.
    </p>

    <pre>
&lt;body&gt;
            ...
        &lt;/body&gt;</pre
    >
  </body>
</html>
